### 1. Checks file types
#### checks.yml
The main checks file. Includes all of the advertised features.  
Conditional commands, optimized checks, increased speed, etc.


### 3. How do I report a change or false positive?
**FIRST:**  
Make sure this isn't an issue with the anticheat itself. Test with the [default Matrix config files](https://github.com/jiangdashao/Matrix-Issues) to see if it's an issue with MatrixChecks. If the issue persists, it's most likely an issue with Matrix. Not all issues can be fixed with a checks file tweak. Head over to [Matrix's support Discord](https://discord.gg/wjheaRj) and ask about the issue, or report the issue at their [issue tracker](https://github.com/jiangdashao/Matrix-Issues/issues).

### 4. There are weird things in my kick messages!
Do the "weird things" look like "`%gp_o_pr%`"? If so, you have not installed `language.yml`.  
This file is required to replace those placeholders with what they're meant to be. [Installation](https://github.com/Encode42/MatrixChecks#server-usage)
